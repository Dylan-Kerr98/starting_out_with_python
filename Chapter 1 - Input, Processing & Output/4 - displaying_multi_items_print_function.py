# Above we called called the print function twice as we needed to display two pieces of data, however, this program can
# be simplified because Python allows us to display multiple items with one call to the print function

# Simplified version below

roomTwo = 504
print('I have now been relocated to room', roomTwo)  # Two arguments passed to the print function

# When multiple arguments are passed to the print function, they are automatically separated by a spaced when displayed
# on the screen
