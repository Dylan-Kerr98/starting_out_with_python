# Instead of using f as the type designator, you can use the % symbol to format a floating-point number as a percentage
# This symbol causes the number to be multiplied by 100 and displayed with a % sign following it

print(format(0.5, '.2%'))    # Output - 50.00%
print(format(0.5, '.0%'))    # Output - 50%
