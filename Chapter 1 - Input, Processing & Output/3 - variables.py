# A variable is a name that represents a value stored in the computer's memory

# You use an assignment statement to create a variable and make in reference a piece of data, below is an example of
# this assignment statement

age = 25

# The = sign is know as the assignment operator

width = 10
length = 5

print(age)
print(width)
print(length)

# The first 3 statements created the variables age, width & length. The following 3 print calls display the values
# stored in these variables

room = 503
print("I am staying in room number")
print(room)

# You cannot use a variable until you have assigned a value to it

# Variables are case sensitive, an error will be thrown if spelling is off, such as when passing the variable as an
# argument

# There are several rules which you must be aware of when naming variables
# You cannot use any Python key words
# Spaces cannot be present
# The first character must be a letter a-z or underscore _
# After the first character you can use characters a-z, digits 0-9 & underscores _

payrate = 8.20           # Legal variable name, but difficult for humans to read
hotdogssoldtoday = 98    # Legal variable name, but difficult for humans to read

# Using underscore's

pay_rate = 8.20             # Legal variable name, but very easy for humans to read
hot_dogs_sold_today = 98    # Legal variable name, but very easy for humans to read

# Using camelCase

payRate = 8.20           # Legal variable name, but very easy for humans to read
hotDogsSoldToday = 98    # Legal variable name, but very easy for humans to read

# 3dGraph - Illegal variable name
# Mixture#3 - Illegal variable name
# pay rate - Illegal variable name
