# The print function can be used to output a string of characters to the computer screen

# When you call the print function, you type the word print followed by a set of parentheses. Inside these you type an
# an argument, which is the data that you want to display. When this is a string the argument most also be enclosed by
# quotation marks
print('hello_world!')

print('Dylan Kerr')
print("3 Clarke's Court, Knockloughrim")
print('BT458RH')

# In this program, the statements will execute in the order that they appear, from the top of the program to the bottom

# If you require a string literal to contain a single-quote or apostrophe as part of the string, you can also enclose
# the string literal in double-quote marks

print("Don't fear!")
print("I'm here!")

# Likewise, you can use single-quote marks to enclose a string literal that contains double quotes as part of the
# string

print('Your assignment is to read "Hamlet" by tomorrow.')

# Python also allows you to enclose string literals in triple quote-marks, either (""" or '''). Triple-quoted strings
# contain both single quotes and double quotes as part of the string

print("""I'm reading "Hamlet" tonight.""")

# These triple quotes can also be used to surround multiline strings, something which single an double quotes cannot be
# used

print("""One
Two
Three""")
