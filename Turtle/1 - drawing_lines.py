# Turtle graphics is an interesting and easy way to learn basic programming concepts
# The Python turtle graphics system simulates a "turtle" that obeys commands to draw simple graphics

# The first step in using Python's turtle graphics is the write the following statement:

import turtle

# This statement is necessary because the turtle graphics system is not built into the Python interpreter and instead
# is stored in a file known as the turtle module

# The import statement loads the turtle module into memory so the Python interpreter can use it

# The Python turtle is initially positioned in the centre of a graphics window that serves as a canvas

# You can enter the following command to display the turtle in its window:

turtle.showturtle()

# Notice the turtle is the shape of an arrow, this is to show the direction that the turtle is currently facing

# The following command makes the turtle advance forward, this distance is given as an argument

turtle.forward(300)

# The following command makes the turtle advance forward, this distance is given as an argument

turtle.done()    # This command means the graphic window will stay open as long as you require it
